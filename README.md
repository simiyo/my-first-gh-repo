# My First GitHub Repo
This is my first GitHub repository.
Ok just testing to see if local changes are auto replicated in GitHub.
# Notes
This page will be used to keep notes as we go along on the use of GitHub.

Tools used to build includes:
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows cmd

This will largely be a self paced piece of work.

# Findings
You can use visual Studio Code to direcly stage (>git add) and push (>git push) your changes from local repo to GitHub.
