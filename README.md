# My First GitHub Repo
This is my first GitHub repository.
Ok just testing to see if local changes are auto replicated in GitHub.
# Notes
This page will be used to keep notes as we go along on the use of GitHub.

Tools used to build includes:
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows cmd
- Linux OS

This will largely be a self paced piece of work.

# Findings
You can use visual Studio Code to direcly stage (>git add) and push (>git push) your changes from local repo to GitHub.


For you to commit from staging to master branch locally, you need to use cmd (>git commit -m "Add your comments in"). 

Interestingly enough if you type (>git commit -a) in cmd; you get a new file that pops up in Visual Studio Code so you can add your comments. Note that you the command forces Visual Studio Code application to run; you will need to add your comments in and then close the comments file in Visual Studio Code before being able to complete the commit.
